This repository hosts the source code of the Tournesol Nano iOS Application.

To learn more about the Tournesol participatory research project and its platform, join
us on [Discord][tournesol-discord-join].

## Set-up

Open the project in Xcode, build, and run! To run on a real device, you need to be logged in with an Apple account with an active Apple Developer Program membership.

To prevent malicious login from an external client, the `client_id` is kept secret and should be replaced in `./tournesol/Resources/Constants/Secrets.swift`. Therefore, the login feature should not be available.

## Copyright & Licenses

In order to share knowledge and creativity efficiently, this Tournesol Nano iOS application
is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later.

See the [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) file for the exhaustive list.

You can find the copyright notice of each software and other production in
their dedicated `README.md` file.
